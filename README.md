# Sponsorship

We are interested in sponsorship, and may run a gofundme or equivalent campaign. Funds or sponsorship may help with:
- Legal guidance
- Server costs (either $ or sponsorship by a cloud hosting provider)
- Compensating volunteers. Many people have lost jobs right now, this seems like reasonable short-term work.

# Contributing

We are all currently volunteers. Many of us have day jobs and are doing this on-the-side.

We'd love your help!

For software-related work, please create or find a github issue. A project maintainer will coordinate with you to make sure someone else isn't already working on a particular task. 

Once you are cleared to work on a feature, task, or bug, create a branch using the git feature-branch workflow. Create a PR when you have made some progress. A maintainer will review PRs when they are ready to be merged.

## CI/CD

Currently deployments are manual. Tiago will be creating a CI/CD pipeline.


## Database

The public datasource is updated on a daily basis. We manually review submissions for new test center locations (made thru a Google Form), and release the new test center updates daily.

We will probably need to automate this process so that test center information is more real-time.

## Infrastructure

We need to adjust to a more robust deployment.

## Mobile optimization

Mobile version of app is slightly disfunctional. 

## React client-side

- Our application is only displaying some of the fields from our dataset. We need to add more fields in our search results.

- We should include a leaflet.js map for more clear search results and national-scope view.

## Overall content

A major potential value-add might be in helping new communities to set up test centers. We can provide these communities with resources. We can link them to other community test centers. We can provide transparency so that communities can share best practices with one another.
